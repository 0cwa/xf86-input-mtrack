Packages

Ebuilds for Gentoo and debs for Ubuntu can be found at

Configuration
-----------------------------------------------------------
The following is a minimal working InputClass section for xorg.conf:

    Section "InputClass"
        MatchIsTouchpad "on"
        Identifier      "Touchpads"
        Driver          "mtrack"
    EndSection

Configuration options may be defined inside the InputClass section
to configure the driver. Available options and their defaults are:

Sensitivity
    Adjusts the sensitivity (movement speed) of the touchpad.
	This is a real number greater than or equal to zero. Default is 1.
	A value of 0 will disable movement.

FingerHigh
    Defines the pressure at which a finger is detected as a touch.
    This is a percentage represented as an integer. Default is 5.

FingerLow
    Defines the pressure at which a finger is detected as a release.
    This is a percentage represented as an integer. Default is 5.

IgnoreThumb
    Whether or not to ignore touches that are determined to be thumbs.
    Boolean value. Defaults to true.

IgnorePalm
    Whether or not to ignore touches that are determined to be palms.
    Boolean value. Defaults to true.

DisableOnThumb
    Whether or not to disable the entire trackpad when a thumb is touching.
    Boolean value. Defaults to false.

DisableOnPalm
    Whether or not to disable the entire trackpad when a palm is touching.
    Boolean value. Defaults to true.

ThumbRatio
    The width/length ratio of what's considered a thumb. It is expected
    that a thumb is longer than it is wide. This tells the driver how much
    longer. Percentage represented by an integer. Defaults to 70.

ThumbSize
    The minimum size of what's considered a thumb. It is expected that a
    thumb will be larger than other fingers. This is represented as a
    percentage of the touchpad height. Integer value. Defaults to 25.

PalmSize
    The minimum size of what's considered a palm. Palms are expected to
    be very large on the trackpad. This is an integer value representing
    a percentage of the height of the trackpad. Defaults to 40.

ButtonEnable
    Whether or not to enable the physical buttons on or near the trackpad.
    Boolean value. Defaults to true.

ButtonIntegrated
    Whether or not the physical buttons are integrated with the trackpad.
    If you have a one-piece trackpad like on newer MacBooks, this should
    be set to true. Button emulation depends on this value being correct.
    Boolean value. Defaults to true.

ClickFinger1
    Which button to emulate when one finger is touching the trackpad during
    a click. Integer value. A value of 0 disables one-touch emulation.
    Defaults to 3.

ClickFinger2
    Which button to emulate when two fingers are touching the trackpad
    during a click. Integer value. A value of 0 disabled one-touch emulation.
    Defaults to 2.

TapButton1
    Which button to emulate for one-finger tapping. Integer value. A value of
    0 disables one-finger tapping. Defaults to 1.

TapButton2
    Which button to emulate for two-finger tapping. Integer value. A value of
    0 disabled two-finger tapping. Defaults to 3.

TapButton3
    Which button to emulate for three-finger tapping. Integer value. A value
    of 0 disabled three-finger tapping. Defaults to 2.

ClickTime
    When tapping, how much time to hold down the emulated button. Integer
    value representing milliseconds. Defaults to 100.

MaxTapTime
    The amount of time to wait for a tap to release before counting it as a
    move. Integer value representing milliseconds. Defaults to 120.

MaxTapMove
    How far a touch is allowed to move before counting it is no longer
    considered a tap. Integer value. Defaults to 400.

GestureClickTime
    When a gesture triggers a click, how much time to hold down the emulated
    button. Integer value representing milliseconds. Defaults to 10.

GestureWaitTime
    Touches are allowed to transition from one gesture to another. For
    example, you may go from scrolling to swiping without releasing your
    fingers from the pad. This value is the amount of time you must be
    performing the new gesture before it is triggered. This prevents
    accidental touches from triggering other gestures. Integer value
    representing milliseconds. Defaults to 100.

ScrollDistance
    For two finger scrolling. How far you must move your fingers before
    a button click is triggered. Integer value. Defaults to 400.

ScrollUpButton
    For two finger scrolling. The button that is triggered by scrolling
    up. Integer value. A value of 0 disables scrolling up. Defaults to 4.

ScrollDownButton
    For two finger scrolling. The button that is triggered by scrolling
    down. Integer value. A value of 0 disables scrolling down. Defaults
    to 5.

ScrollLeftButton
    For two finger scrolling. The button that is triggered by scrolling
    left. Integer value. A value of 0 disables scrolling left. Defaults
    to 6.

ScrollDownButton
    For two finger scrolling. The button that is triggered by scrolling
    right. Integer value. A value of 0 disables scrolling right. Defaults
    to 7.

SwipeDistance
    For three finger swiping. How far you must move your fingers before
    a button click is triggered. Integer value. Defaults to 700.

SwipeUpButton
    For three finger swiping. The button that is triggered by swiping
    up. Integer value. A value of 0 disables swiping up. Defaults to 8.

SwipeDownButton
    For three finger swiping. The button that is triggered by swiping
    down. Integer value. A value of 0 disables swiping down. Defaults
    to 9.

SwipeLeftButton
    For three finger swiping. The button that is triggered by swiping
    left. Integer value. A value of 0 disables swiping left. Defaults
    to 10.

SwipeRightButton
    For three finger swiping. The button that is triggered by swiping
    right. Integer value. A value of 0 disables swiping right. Defaults
    to 11.

ScaleDistance
    For pinch scaling. How far you must move your fingers before a
    button click is triggered. Integer value. Defaults to 150.

ScaleUpButton
    For pinch scaling. The button that is triggered by scaling up.
    Integer value. A value of 0 disables scaling up. Defaults to 12.

ScaleDownButton
    For pinch scaling. The button that is triggered by scaling down.
    Integer value. A value of 0 disables scaling down. Defaults to 13.

RotateDistance
    For two finger rotation. How far you must move your fingers before
    a button click is triggered. Integer value. Defaults to 150.

RotateLeftButton
    For two finger rotation. The button that is triggered by rotating
    left. Integer value. A value of 0 disables rotation left. Defaults
    to 14.

RotateRightButton
    For two finger rotation. The button that is triggered by rotating
    right. Integer value. A value of 0 disables rotation right. Defaults
    to 14.

TapDragEnable
    Whether or not to enable tap-to-drag functionality. Boolean value.
    Defaults to true.

TapDragTime
    The tap-to-drag timeout. This is how long the driver will wait
    after a single tap for a movement event before sending the click.
    Integer value representing milliseconds. Defaults to 200.
